## How to Run

1. Download or clone the project files into a folder on your computer. [web:6][web:8]  
2. Make sure `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` are in the same folder (or update paths if using subfolders). [web:3]  
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.). [web:2][web:6]  
4. Start playing Tic-Tac-Toe by clicking on any empty cell in the grid. [web:2][web:3]

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3×3 grid. [web:2]  
- Player X and Player O take turns marking one empty cell per turn. [web:2][web:3]  
- A player wins if they place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. [web:2][web:3]  
- If all 9 cells are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw. [web:2]

## Possible Improvements

You can extend this project with:

- Single-player mode with basic AI (computer opponent). [web:18]  
- Scoreboard to track wins, losses, and draws over multiple rounds. [web:6][web:15]  
- Animations and sound effects for moves and game results. [web:6][web:18]  
- Mobile-friendly UI tweaks and better accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels). [web:3][web:6]
